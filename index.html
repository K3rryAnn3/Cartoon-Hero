	<h2>Rogue's Story</h2>
	<img src="img/Rogue6.jpeg">
	<p>Rogue is a superhero who belongs to the Marvel universe. She's one of Professor Xaviers (Prof X) students, and a member of the XMen. She has the ability to absorb other mutants powers, to the deteriment of the mutant. So, she can't have physical contact with anyone; as, if she touches a mutant for too long she can send them into a coma. In one epic confrontation she took on another mutant with super strength and flying capabilities, absorbing these powers permanently. Unfortunately, Rogue placed the mutant into a coma. She's conflicted and battles this inner turmoil, often resolving her dark leanings towards a higher understanding of humanity and human fragility.</p>
